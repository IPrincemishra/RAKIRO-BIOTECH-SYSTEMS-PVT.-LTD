To Rakiro Biotech Systems Pvt. Ltd.,

I am writing to you regarding the website I developed for your SME division. I worked on this project under the supervision of Vishal Sir. Unfortunately, I have not received payment for the past four months, and I have been unable to get a response from Vishal Sir for the last month.

As a result of this lack of payment and communication, I am now considering making the website code publicly available. I have uploaded the project to GitHub as an open-source project: https://github.com/IPrincemishra/RAKIRO-BIOTECH-SYSTEMS-PVT.-LTD

Furthermore, if I do not receive a response and resolution to this payment issue, I will be forced to host the website on GitHub with a clear indication that Rakiro Biotech Systems Pvt. Ltd. has outstanding payment obligations.

I am sending this email to ensure that the SME team is aware of this situation and the potential consequences. I sincerely hope we can resolve this matter amicably and avoid further action.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely
